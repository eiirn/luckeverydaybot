*How the Bot Works:*
• Bot accepts star transactions from users and adds to bot's daily pool.
• At 11:59 PM GMT, an automated algorithm randomly selects a winner and sends the prize pool worth of Telegram Gifts to them.

Our bot's code is completely open source! Feel free to inspect the code anytime — transparency is our priority.

*Game Rules:*
• The prize pool consists of all user contributions minus 15% service fee.

• More contributed stars increase the chances of winning.  
• VIP users, Telegram Premium users, referrals, and our channel/chat members receive extra weightage.  
• A random probability factor ensures fairness.  
• If the total gifts don't match the prize pool, the remaining balance stays with the bot and is added to the user's future winnings.
